## Lesson 1: Building Blocks of Mutual Funds
### Definition of a Mutual Fund
- Collection of different TYPES of securities (e.g., bonds, equities, etc); no limit on the number of them.
- __Holdings__ - another term for the collection of securities in a MF

### How to Evaluate MFs
There are two key metrics/ways to evaluate mutual funds:
   1. Performance
   2. Return

### Investment Goals (Objectives) - 3 types of funds
There are different types of mutual funds based on the goal of the MF
1. __Safety (of Principal) MF__ - make sure the client gets AT LEAST the original investment back
   - if your client is planning on using their money soon (e.g., school, new house, baby, etc)
2. __Income MF__ - steady income during the course of their investment
   - not as safe as a safety mutual fund; price will fluctuate and in a dip, if the client takes their money out they may get less than their original investment (aka principal_
   - often recommended to seniors who need a steady source of income after retirement to supplement a retirement fund
3. __Growth MF__ - are more likely to increase in value over time, but come at a higher risk.  The hope is that the market price will increase and be more than the original purchase price when they sell.  
   - often recommended when you're younger and have more time to invest before retiring


## Lesson 2: Fixed Income Securities
Debt issued by corporation or governments.  The client is really lending their money to the corp/govt for them to use and they pay you interest on it.

## Lesson 3: Bonds

## Lesson 4: Equities
