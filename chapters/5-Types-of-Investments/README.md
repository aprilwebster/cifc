## Lesson 1: Building Blocks of Mutual Funds
### Definition of a Mutual Fund
- Collection of different TYPES of securities (e.g., bonds, equities, etc); no limit on the number of them.
- __Holdings__ - another term for the collection of securities in a MF

### How to Evaluate MFs
There are two key metrics/ways to evaluate mutual funds:
   1. Performance
   2. Return

### Investment Goals (Objectives) - 3 types of funds
There are different types of mutual funds based on the goal of the MF
1. __Safety (of Principal) MF__ - make sure the client gets AT LEAST the original investment back
   - if your client is planning on using their money soon (e.g., school, new house, baby, etc)
2. __Income MF__ - steady income during the course of their investment
   - not as safe as a safety mutual fund; price will fluctuate and in a dip, if the client takes their money out they may get less than their original investment (aka principal_
   - often recommended to seniors who need a steady source of income after retirement to supplement a retirement fund
3. __Growth MF__ - are more likely to increase in value over time, but come at a higher risk.  The hope is that the market price will increase and be more than the original purchase price when they sell.  
   - often recommended when you're younger and have more time to invest before retiring

### Why do Corporations and Government issue Securities?
To raise capital (i.e., money) to pay for stuff

#### Governments
- Pay for public spending on things like roads, healthcare, military
- 3 Types that differ in how long it takes for them to mature:
   1. Short-term: <= 5 yrs
      - treasury bills, and provincial or municipal short-term papers.
   2. Medium-term: 5-10 yrs
      - municipal (city/town), provincial or federal __bonds__
   3. Long-term: 10+ yrs
      - Government of Canada __bonds__

Debt issued by corporation or governments.  The client is really lending their money to the corp/govt for them to use and they pay you interest on it.
